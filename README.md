## Howdy! I'm Adam.

As of Fall 2024, I'm pursuing my MS in Software Engineering at DePaul after 11 years in the coffee industry. While I'm not studying and working on projects (which I honestly love), I climb, bike around Chicago, sing emo classics at karaoke, and cuddle with my dog and two cats.

**Here are a couple of my releases:**
- [Madlib Machine](https://github.com/adam-lev-barnett/madlib-machine): Creates a madlib from any .txt file and prompts user to fill it in
- [TextQuest](https://github.com/adam-lev-barnett/CSC403-TextQuest): A spooky mini text adventure game
